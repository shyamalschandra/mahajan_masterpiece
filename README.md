# ECG Classification Models: A Comparative Study

This repository implements and compares seven deep learning architectures for ECG classification:

1. **Feedforward Neural Network** (Lloyd et al., 2001) - A feedforward neural network from scratch using NumPy
2. **Transformer-based Model** (Ikram et al., 2025) - Transformer architecture for ECG classification
3. **Three-Stage Hierarchical Transformer (3stageFormer)** (Tang et al., 2025) - Multi-scale hierarchical transformer
4. **1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** - Local pattern extraction using convolution
5. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** - Sequential modeling with recurrent connections
6. **Hopfield Network** (ETASR, 2013) - Energy-based associative memory for pattern recognition
7. **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** (van de Leur et al., 2022) - Explainable ECG classification using latent factors

The feedforward neural network implementation is designed for ECG analysis and heart disease prediction tasks, based on research published in *Circulation* (2001) on detecting ischemia in electrocardiograms using artificial neural networks.

## Features

### Feedforward Neural Network
- **Multi-layer perceptron**: Configurable architecture
- **Backpropagation**: Gradient descent with mini-batch support
- **Multiple Activation Functions**: Sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU
- **Training Features**: 
  - Early stopping
  - Validation monitoring
  - Training history tracking
  - Loss and accuracy visualization

### Transformer-based Model
- **Multi-head self-attention**: Captures temporal dependencies
- **Positional encoding**: Preserves temporal information
- **End-to-end learning**: Directly from raw ECG signals

### Three-Stage Hierarchical Transformer (3stageFormer)
- **Multi-scale processing**: Three stages at different temporal resolutions
- **Hierarchical feature extraction**: Captures both local and global patterns
- **Feature fusion**: Combines multi-scale representations for classification

### 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Local pattern extraction**: Convolutional kernels detect morphological features
- **Translation invariance**: Recognizes patterns regardless of position
- **Efficiency**: Fast training and inference with good accuracy

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- **Sequential modeling**: Processes signals step-by-step with memory
- **Bidirectional context**: Considers both past and future information
- **Gating mechanisms**: Selectively remembers important information

### Hopfield Network

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from neural_network import NeuralNetwork
import numpy as np

# Prepare your data
# X should be shape (n_samples, n_features)
# y should be shape (n_samples, 1) with binary labels (0 or 1)

# Normalize features
X_train = (X_train - X_train.mean(axis=0)) / X_train.std(axis=0)

# Initialize network
nn = NeuralNetwork(
    input_size=10,           # Number of input features
    hidden_layers=[16, 8],   # Two hidden layers with 16 and 8 neurons
    output_size=1,           # Binary classification
    activation='sigmoid',    # or 'tanh', 'relu'
    learning_rate=0.01
)

# Train the network
history = nn.train(
    X_train, y_train,
    X_val, y_val,
    epochs=1000,
    batch_size=32,
    early_stopping=True,
    patience=20
)

# Make predictions
predictions = nn.predict(X_test)
probabilities = nn.predict_proba(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = nn.compute_accuracy(y_test, predictions)

## Network Architecture

The default architecture follows a typical pattern for medical classification:
- **Input Layer**: Number of features (e.g., ECG features, patient demographics)
- **Hidden Layers**: Configurable (default: 16 → 8 neurons)
- **Output Layer**: Single neuron with sigmoid activation for binary classification

nn = NeuralNetwork(
    input_size=20,              # Your feature count
    hidden_layers=[32, 16, 8], # Add more layers
    output_size=1,
    activation='relu',          # Try different activations
    learning_rate=0.001         # Adjust learning rate
)
```

### Training Parameters

- `epochs`: Number of training iterations

## Data Format

- **Input (X)**: NumPy array of shape `(n_samples, n_features)`

- **Labels (y)**: NumPy array of shape `(n_samples, 1)`
  - Binary labels: 0 (negative) or 1 (positive)
  - Example: 0 = no ischemia, 1 = ischemia detected

## Implementation Details
